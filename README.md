# SyntaxSocial
Our group project for cs421. Syntax Social is a social media web application for computer scientists.

# Orginization
There are two directories, [syntaxsoc-client](https://github.com/dbalfour8480/Social-Media-App-Home/tree/main/syntaxsoc-client), and [syntaxsoc-node-app](https://github.com/dbalfour8480/Social-Media-App-Home/tree/main/syntaxsoc-node-app).

The client runs on React + Vite, and the server is nodejs with LightSQL as the database.



# Setup for development

To begin development, clone this repository and then follow the README in [syntaxsoc-client](https://github.com/dbalfour8480/Social-Media-App-Home/tree/main/syntaxsoc-client) and [syntaxsoc-node-app](https://github.com/dbalfour8480/Social-Media-App-Home/tree/main/syntaxsoc-node-app).

Once both servers are running, the backend functionality should work and let the user login. 


# TODO

Still need to add:


* Follow System
* Post interactions
* Allow user to upload profile pictures
